# Azure AI Model Inference

The Azure AI Model Inference is an API that exposes a common set of capabilities for foundational models and that can be used by developers to consume predictions from a diverse set of models in a uniform and consistent way. Developers can talk with different models deployed in Azure AI Foundry portal without changing the underlying code they are using.
